Assignment Summary:

For each question below, write a program to solve it. Each program can be written in C/C++, Java, or Python.
Each problem has 20 test cases associated with it â€” four are posted along with this assignment, and 16 will remain
hidden. For a test case you will lose all five marks if your program is either incorrect or if it takes much longer than the time limit (~5s).

For the fourth (bonus) problem, there are again 20 test cases (four visible and 16 hidden). However, this problem
is much harder to solve.
